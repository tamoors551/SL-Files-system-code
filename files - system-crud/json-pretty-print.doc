JSON_PRETTY_PRINT is a PHP function that is used to format and indent JSON data in a more readable and visually appealing way. 

This function takes a JSON-encoded string as input and returns a formatted version of the data.

Here's an example of how to use JSON_PRETTY_PRINT in PHP:

$json_data = '{"name":"John Doe","age":30,"email":"johndoe@example.com"}';


$pretty_json = json_encode($json_data, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);

echo $pretty_json;

The output of the above code will be:

{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}

* As you can see, the JSON data is now formatted with proper indentation and spacing, making it much easier to read and understand.
